# Quora-Duplicate-Question-Predictor
Built a model that can predict whether two questions are duplicates on the Quora forum using NLP and machine learning. Best performance was using XGBoost and basic features


Processed a dataset of text and applied XGBoost to predict duplicate questions with a 71% accuracy score.
Future work could include data balancing techniques, creating different/more features, and applying a neural network.

Main packages used are: pandas, numpy, mltk, sklearn, gensim, scipy, xgboost, matplotlib
